# Forest Group website

**LINK:** [Forest Group website](https://maxpolak04.github.io/)

The Forest Group website is my first such large-scale project. In creating this project, I wanted to test myself in creating websites using the skills I had acquired.
The Forest Group website is written by me from scratch based on a mockup and some requirements I got in the assignment.
The project uses several technologies in addition to HTML, CSS and JS are git, kits and sass. In addition, it uses SEO and BEM methodologies. 
The project is not perfect and may contain errors, e.g. SEO may not work the way I wanted it to (I had problems doing it on github), but for me it is a great success and learning progress.
